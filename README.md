## Description: 
Contained in this repository is a web based arcade-style game called 'Tommy Cross'. 
Tommy Cross is the main character in the game and he needs to cross the road to reach the
water safely.

He spawns in the beginning of the game on safe grass tiles and has to cross the stone tiles to reach the water. 
The stone tiles, however, are very dangerous for Tommy, because there are bugs moving at various speeds. 
If Tommy collides with one of these bugs, he loses a 'life'. If he loses all three of his 'lives', the game ends 
and he wont be able to go swimming (in other words, the user loses the game)!

However, although the stone tiles are dangerous, they are also an incentive to spend time on them.
Everytime he lands on a stone tile safely, he earns five points. If he lands on a special, glowing tile, he will gain
a constant stream of points for however long he is on it safely. The goal of the game is to reach the water and get the most possible points!

As gametime is elapsed, the game progressively gets harder. It gets harder because Tommy can safely walk on the grass
spaces to avoid the nasty bugs. However, a landslade occurs at random intervals, making some grass and water squares
unusable because a boulder has landed there. Although dont worry too much Tommy will remain safe from the landslide, because they cant land on him. But they do make his life more inconven

So be careful, have fun, and help Tommy reach the end! 

##Purpose:     
To create a Frogger-like arcade game that I believe creates a fun and refreshingly new user experience. Although
Frogger has always been one of my favorite arcade games, I always enjoyed the part where you get to cross the road
rather then deal with various other situations (like going on logs/alligators and other things). This game allows 
the user to only cross the road, and stay on the road, and earn as many points as possible. This took my favorite 
part of Frogger and made a playable game out of it, which I am very proud of.
